# Ownership Research Assessment

This project involves researching the ownership of energy generation projects (solar, wind, storage, gas) across various North American regions. The goal is to identify the correct project owners and provide credible source links for verification.

## Summary

Each project is reviewed using:
- Public interconnection queue data (PJM, MISO, AESO, IESO, etc.)
- Regulatory filings, utility commission documents, and developer websites
- Clues like email domains, capacity, fuel type, and queue IDs

Final results are recorded in a spreadsheet that includes:
- Project name
- Location and ISO
- Verified owner(s)
- Source link(s) used to confirm ownership

## Output

The key deliverable is a spreadsheet with updated owner and source information for each project.
